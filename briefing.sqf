How to play:<br />
To begin the game, a randomly selected player is 'it'. He may choose a position by opening his map and shift-alt-clicking on a position. As soon as he has done that every player that is connected will be placed in that area.
All players except the player that is 'it' have 10 seconds to run away. After 10 seconds the player that is 'it' will receive a gun with unlimited ammo. To tag a player he needs to shoot the player.
When the person that is 'it' shoots his gun and hits another player the other player will become 'it'.
<br /><br />
Points:<br />
Players will receive 10 points every 30 seconds when inside the area. If a player ventures outside the area points will be substracted every 5 seconds.
When a player gets tagged the supposed damage will be substracted from his score. He will not receive points for as long as he is 'it'.
When someone gets to the max amount of points the game is ended and the winner is revealed.
<br /><br />
Ammobox:<br />
There is an ammobox placed in the middle of the area with Magazines and Maps. The ammobox also has some special options, so take a look!
